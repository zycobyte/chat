        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <h3>We are Eien.no Chat.</h3>
        We are a chat website based in the UK who want to make a difference in the world.  We would love it if you checked out our site and hope that you enjoy every moment you spend with us!
    </div>

    <div class="box" id="what">
        <h1>What is Eien.no Chat?</h1>
        Eien.no Chat is a friendly place for users to chat with friends and family and meet new people.  We provide a free, easy-to-use service that allows people to contact anyone across the globe so long as they have
        access to the internet.<br>
        It includes a variety of features in it that are popular and beloved by most people but are not included in many apps, meaning they can't be used regularly.  It also offers many unique features that you will love!
        More details on the features can be found on the <a href="../features/">features</a> page.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="box" id="why">
        <h1>Why did we make Eien.no Chat?</h1>
        We created Eien.no Chat to bring the world closer together for people who live far apart.  This means you can all enjoy those magical moments together, no matter where you are on the globe.<br>
        It is always important to keep in touch with people you are close to, no matter what, because they are the ones who will make you happy and help you throughout your life.  For this reason we
        decided to make it free to use and to not force our users to be over the age of 13.  Although this may be controversial, as it is commonly stated that under 13s are more likely to give out personal
        info or get cyber bullied, we take extra precautions to make sure this doesn't happen, by using algorithms that check for the slightest chance that something could be up.  If you are a parent of a younger child,
        we recommend that you make your child sign up with your E-Mail as you will get alerts if they ever try to turn this setting off or someone says something suspicious to them.<br>
        We also provide a unique service with fast customer support and friendly staff who you can easily contact via the <a href="../contact/">contact</a> page.

    <div class="box" id="when">
        <h1>When was Eien.no Chat created?</h1>
        We originally started planning Eien.no Chat back in late October, 2017.  We had a working (beta) site by the 12 of November and decided that it was time to buy the domain and release the site to the public.<br>
        We continued to work on the site with the small amount of feedback we got and the site ran for just over a month until early January before we decided to temporarily take it down and upgrade it to a full release
        version.  This was where we decided to spend a lot of time making it look nicer and run faster as the beta version had been released fairly quickly just to see what people thought about the idea.<br>
        While updating the site we decided to release the new home pages on the 14th of January, and to release the chat page once we had finished all the back-end programming, which is still in progress<br>
