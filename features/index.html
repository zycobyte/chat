    </div>
    <!--Slide to the left-->
    <div class="slide-left box" id="simple">
        <h2>Easy to use</h2>
        Eien.no Chat was designed to be simple to use so that anyone can create an account and start making friends in seconds!  It has a design that can be understood by almost anyone and provides help boxes you can hover over
        to find out more information about many different things if you are still unsure about anything.
    </div>
    <!--Slide to the right-->
    <div class="slide-right box" id="safe">
        <h2>Safe and secure</h2>
        Eien.no Chats number one goal is to provide a safe place to talk to people to keep everyone connected.  We have features in place to combat cyber bullying and to protect the younger generations as they may not be aware of the dangers of
        giving out personal information online.  We also encrypt data so no hackers are able to grab it while it travels through the vast unprotected cyberspace.
    </div>
    <!--Criss cross-->
    <div class="slide-left box" id="modern">
        <h2>Modern style</h2>
        We have worked hard to try and provide a nice modern design that doesn't hurt your eyes after you have been looking at it for a while.  Many services seem to just throw everything together into a website or file
        and say 'here you go now give us money', whereas we have actually put effort into something that you will enjoy using and not get a headache from looking at.<br>
        Not only have we made the design look nice but we have organised everything in so that you can easily access it without needing to resort to using google or some other search engine.
    </div>
    <!--Criss cross-->
    <div class="slide-right box" id="friends">
        <h2>Add friends</h2>
        Life is better with friends, so you can add as many as you want with no limit whatsoever.  Whether you have been friends for 10 days or 10 years or live across the road or across the globe there is nothing stopping
        you from adding your friends and having a nice chat with them any time you feel like it.  You can even add your closest of friends to a special list which allows you to keep them closer and puts a little symbol of your
        choice next to their name!
    </div>
    <!--FREEZE-->
    <div class="slide-left box" id="chats">
        <h2>Different ways to chat</h2>
        Create Chat Groups for you and your friends to have fun, join public Chat Groups based around the things that you love and meet like-minded people or simply start a DM if you just want a private place to chat with 1 other
        person.  You can do all of these with the press of a button and if you find yourself searching through 50 different chats just to find the one you want to talk in, don't worry.  You can easily search for the chat you
        want to use by typing its name into the search area or adding it to your favourites.

    </div>
    <!--Every body clap your hands-->
    <div class="slide-right box" id="online">
        <h2>Advanced appear online options</h2>
        The majority of services out there force you to only choose from online, do not disturb or invisible, maybe with one or 2 more.  This doesn't always allow you to set the correct mode, for example what if you're playing
        a game and you want to let people know that you will take a while to reply.  You can't.  You either need to tell them you're online and responding to messages or you are not replying to anything.  There are many other times
        where this can be a problem so that's why we have given you an option to create your own ones!  That's right, you can set your online status to be any colour with any name you want.  Not only that but you can also
        add custom messages to be send when someone DM's you or @'s you.  You can even set it to automatically change your online status throughout the day if you leave your pc on 24/7.  This means everyday while at school or
        work you can set it so if anyone messages you they will be sent the message 'Sorry, I'm at school/work rn.  I'll get back to you later' without you needing to take precious time out of your morning to set it up each day.
    </div>
    <!--I am so sorry to anyone in f12 mode.  That song just popped into my head.-->
    <div class="slide-left box" id="gifs">
        <h2>Send Gifs and stickers</h2>
        Everyone loves gifs and stickers, so we have a range of gifs and stickers that you can send to any chat at any time.  We also have special commands you can type that will send images to the chat, such as '#aesthetic'
        to send an aesthetic image, '#animal' to send a photo of an animal '#babyanimal' to send a photo of a baby animal and many more!
    </div>
    <div class="slide-right box" id="edit">
        <h2>Easily edit your Chat Groups</h2>
        Tired of trying to update your chat to have cool new things and having people constantly saying 'What are you doing?' and talking in the new channels before they are ready?  Don't worry! If you are the owner of a Chat
        Group, you can easily disable users from accessing your chat unless they have been added to a special list.  If they aren't on that list they will be displayed with a custom message set by you telling them whats going on.<br>
        This feature also doubles up as a way to sort out large problems without chaos forming.  If, for example, someone has decided to raid your public Chat Group then you could simply turn on this 'maintenance' mode and
        remove them from the server without them being able to carry on spamming.
    </div>
