The main branch is where the site is hosted.  DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER BRANCH.

# Commits
Commit to a seperate branch in the for Vx.x.x-username, eg if I was to commit a file for version 1.1.1, I would commit it to the branch: v1.1.1-LavaTheif

If you require the most up-to-date version of the update, there will be an additional branch with just the version name, eg V-1.1.1, where all code will be merged to once the code is accepted.
