The main branch is where the site is hosted.  DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.

# Commits
Commit to a seperate branch in the for Vx.x.x-username, eg if I was to commit a file for version 1.1.1, I would commit it to the branch: v1.1.1-LavaTheif

There will always be a main branch for the version, eg called V-1.1.1, that will contain the merged pull requests, and therefore the most up-to-date code for that version.
