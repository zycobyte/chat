            <h1>Welcome to Eien.no Chat!</h1>
            Eien.no Chat is under development and estimated to be released some time in late February.  If you would like to help with Eien.no Chats Development, click <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/eienno-chat" target="_blank">here</a><br>
            <br>
            Eien.no Chat is a social media platform created for friends and families to keep in contact, meet new people and enjoy doing things they love!  It is designed so you can easily plan things in groups, meet new people, chill with friends and much more!<br>
            <br>
            And for those parents out there worried about their child's online safety, don't worry.  Safety is our number one priority.

            <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Eien.no Chat is completely free :D</h3>
            <!--<br>-->
            Why should we put a price on your friendship and say "You need to pay &ltinsert a ton of money here&gt or lose contact with this friend completely"?  That would just be ridiculous and you wouldn't bother with using Eien.no Chat, so whats the point in continuing to use the other companies that value money more than your friendship.

            You can be any age, because like we said safety is our number one priority.  If we believe you are being sent weird messages we will give you a prompt to let you know you shouldn't answer unless you know them in real life.  We also make it easy for you to block these users so they wont trouble you again.<br>
            <h3>What if I get these prompts because my friends send me weird messages as a joke?</h3>
            Don't worry, you can add or remove anyone to from 'ignore' list at anytime to not receive these prompts from friends, or disable it all together if you know how to stay safe online.

            <h1>What's the point of using Eien.no Chat instead of Skype or Discord?</h1>
            <br>
            We have done extensive research into what people like about the popular chat services and what they don't like, and have made sure Eien.no Chat only has features that people like while removing the ones people hate.  Not only that, we have added our own custom features that no other services have and are only available here!<br>
            This means you get the things you love like easily talking to friends without the annoying things you hate like being forced to search through a huge list of chats instead of just typing its name and having it brought straight to you.
